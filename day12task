*what is dictionory?
-->A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces `{}`, allowing efficient data retrieval based on keys rather than indexes.
   Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any data type, enabling flexible data organization and storage.

*how to add elements in dictonary?what are the methods to add elements?
-->To add elements to a dictionary in Python, you can simply assign a value to a new key or update an existing key with a new value using square brackets notation or the update() method.
  Ex:
    -Using square brackets notation:
     my_dict = {}
     my_dict['key1'] = 'value1'
     my_dict['key2'] = 'value2'

   -Using the update() method:
    my_dict = {}
    my_dict.update({'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'})
  bothg thge mnethods are used to add key value pairs.

*what is tuple?
-->A tuple in Python is an immutable, ordered collection of elements enclosed within parentheses, 
   allowing for the storage of heterogeneous data types and facilitating data integrity and safety in assignments and passing parameters.

*what are methods to print keys?
-->
   - Using keys() Method: Invoking the keys() method on a dictionary returns a view object containing all the keys, which can be printed.
   - Looping Through Keys: Iterating directly over the dictionary allows you to access and print each key individually.

*what are methods to print values?
-->
   - values() Method: Utilize the values() method on a dictionary to retrieve a view object containing all values, which can then be printed.
   - Iteration: Iterate directly over the dictionary and print each value individually by accessing them through a loop.
